        <p> Welcome to Oak & Steam. A space created for slow mornings, good conversations, and quality coffee.</p>
        <p>We believe a coffee shop should feel like more than a stop in your day, it should feel like a pause, a breath, a moment of warmth. That’s why every drink we make is crafted with care, every bean is ethically sourced, and every detail of our space is designed to make you feel at home.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re studying, meeting friends, dreaming big, or simply stopping for your morning latte, we’re here to serve something meaningful — a cup of comfort, community, and creativity.</p>
        <p>At Oak & Steam, you will always find quality ingredients, thoughtfully crafted drinks, friendly baristas who remember your order, and a cozy environment designed to inspire. We're more than a cafe, we're a community.</p>
